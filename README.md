# 📘 GenAI Learning Repository

This repository contains my structured learning notes while studying **Generative AI**.  
Each subfolder focuses on a specific topic and includes concise explanations, examples, and code snippets for quick revision and practical understanding.

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in modern GenAI tools and workflows through hands-on learning.

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

- LangChain fundamentals
- Prompt engineering concepts
- Structured outputs & parsers
- Chains and runnables
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM workflows and experiments
- Practical GenAI patterns

Each folder acts like a mini chapter of notes.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surajchaudhary26/GenAI.git
cd GenAI
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create `.env` file (important)

Create a `.env` file in the **root folder** and add your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = ""
GOOGLE_API_KEY = ""
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN = ""

```

You can use **any model of your choice** depending on your provider.

---

## ▶️ Running Examples

Open any folder and run the scripts:

```bash
python example.py
```

Each script is independent and demonstrates one GenAI concept.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is:

- a personal GenAI study notebook
- a quick reference for concepts
- a hands-on learning archive
- preparation material for AI / LLM engineering
